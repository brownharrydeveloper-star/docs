Rugpull.software is built to transform passive capital into coordinated market control on BNB Chain.

The RugPull infrastructure consists of two core components:

1. **[rugpull.software](https://rugpull.software) App** - Allows users to contribute capital into a coordinated liquidity pool, where assets are actively deployed to influence liquidity flow and price direction across selected memecoin markets. Participants earn rewards based on their contribution weight, operating as part of the market coordination layer rather than as passive traders.

2. **RugPull Network Insight** - A continuously operating distributed network of nodes, routers, and validators. The system leverages AI-driven execution and routing logic to synchronize liquidity, manage market pressure, and sustain memecoin ecosystems at scale.
