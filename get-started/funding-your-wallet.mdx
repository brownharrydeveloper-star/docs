## Centralized Exchange method

Funding your wallet is relatively easy if you already have an account on a centralized exchange, such as Binance or Coinbase. In short, it comes down to withdrawing your crypto from the exchange to your wallet address. In the process, you choose the coin to withdraw and the blockchain network on which you wish to receive the crypto asset.
