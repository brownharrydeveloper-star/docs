</Warning>

## Do I need special hardware to participate?

Participants only need to stake supported tokens through rugpull.software. No additional hardware, infrastructure, or technical setup is required.

## What is a Rughopper?

A Rughopper is a hardware-based participant that runs RugPull software to directly support AI-managed memecoin markets. Unlike standard users who stake funds into a pool, Rughoppers provide computing resources and allow capital to remain in their own wallets while participating in market operations.

## How is Rughopper different from regular staking?

Regular staking requires users to lock funds into a pool for a fixed period. Rughoppers do not deposit capital into a pool — assets remain in the user's wallet and can be withdrawn at any time, as long as minimum participation duration requirements are met.

## What do I need to run a Rughopper?

Running a Rughopper requires dedicated hardware and the RugPull software provided by the platform. The device must remain connected to the internet 24/7 to maintain active participation.

## What tokens can I use?

Rughoppers can operate using any supported token listed on the RugPull staking interface. The minimum participation requirement is a token value equivalent to at least 10 USDT.

## Is there a limit on how many Rughoppers I can run?

No. There is no restriction on the number of wallets, devices, or instances a participant may run.

## What do Rughoppers actually do?

Rughoppers provide computing power and support AI-driven processes that:
- Deploy new memecoin markets on BNB Chain
- Provide and manage liquidity
- Participate in early market formation and price discovery
- Support continuous execution and market coordination

## How is my capital used?

Capital remains in the user's wallet and is referenced by the system for participation weight. Liquidity deployment and execution are coordinated by RugPull's AI systems without requiring funds to be locked in a central pool.

## How are rewards generated?

Rewards are generated from:
- Trading fees
- Market volatility captured through coordinated execution
- Additional protocol-level revenue sources

Rewards are variable, non-fixed, and distributed proportionally based on participation weight.

## Is this passive income?

No. Rughopper participation represents active involvement in market coordination rather than passive yield farming.

## Are returns guaranteed?

Rewards are not fixed and may vary depending on market conditions, execution performance, and network activity. Returns are based on participation weight and system performance.

## Can I withdraw my funds anytime?

Yes. Funds remain in the user's wallet and can be withdrawn at any time, subject to minimum participation duration requirements for reward eligibility.

## Do I need to approve transactions manually?

No. Once set up, Rughopper runs automatically and does not require continuous transaction signing or manual intervention.

## What happens if market conditions change?

AI systems may adjust strategies dynamically based on market conditions. Rughoppers continue operating without requiring configuration changes or manual updates.

## What are the risks?

Participation may be affected by:
- Overall market volatility
- Smart contract risks
- BNB Chain network conditions

RugPull does not eliminate market risk, but operates mechanisms designed to manage it.

## Does RugPull guarantee returns?

RugPull does not offer fixed or guaranteed returns. Returns depend on market activity, system execution, and participation conditions.
