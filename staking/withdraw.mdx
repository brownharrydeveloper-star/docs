## How Withdrawal Works

Withdrawal follows a fixed process to ensure accuracy and on-chain security.

## 1. Claim Your Rewards

- Go to **Active Positions**
- Tap **Claim** or **Claim All** to move your Total Earned rewards into Claimable balance
- If rewards are not claimed, your Withdrawable balance will remain 0

<Warning>
You must claim rewards before you can withdraw them.
